This repository is intended to drive collaboration on guidelines for building a community to create and manage sample projects which demonstrate best practices for web components and web platform focused development.

We, as a community, recognize that there simply are not enough hours in a day for project owners to maintain sponsored development projects. This is an effort to alleviate that pressure and leverage the stregths of a community who's members are devoted to developing for the (open) modern web.
